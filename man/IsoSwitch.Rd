\arguments{
\item{MarvelObject}{Marvel object. S3 object generated from \code{CompareValues.Genes.10x} function.}

\item{method}{Character string. The statistical method used for differential splicing analysis.}

\item{psi.pval}{Numeric value. Adjusted p-value below which the splicing event is considered differentially spliced and included for isoform switching analysis. To be used in conjunction with \code{psi.delta}.}

\item{psi.delta}{Numeric value. The absolute mininum difference in PSI values between the two cell groups above which the splicing event is considered differentially spliced nd included for isoform switching analysis. To be used in conjunction with \code{psi.pval}. Specify \code{0} (default) to switch this threshold off.}

\item{gene.pval}{Numeric value. Adjusted p-value below which the gene is considered differentially expressed. Default value is \code{0.1}.}

\item{gene.log2fc}{Numeric value. The absolute log2 fold change in mean gene expression values between the two cell groups above which the gene is considered differentially expressed. To be used in conjunction with \code{gene.pval}. Specify \code{0} to switch this threshold off. Default value is \code{0.5}.}

\value{
An object of class S3 containing with new slots \code{MarvelObject$DE$Cor$Table}, \code{MarvelObject$DE$Cor$Plot}, and \code{MarvelObject$DE$Cor$Plot.Stats}.

\description{
Classify gene-splicing relative changes to each other from cell group 1 to group 2. Classifications are coordinated, opposing, isoform-switching, and complex. In coordinated relationship, both gene and splicing changes in the same direction from cell group 1 to group 2. In opposing relationship, gene changes in the opposite direction relative to splicing from cell group 1 to group 2. In isoform-switching, there is differential splice junction usage without differential expression of the corresponding gene between cell group 1 and group 2. Complex relationship involves genes with both coordinated and opposing relationships with splicing. Only differentially spliced junctions are included for analysis here.
